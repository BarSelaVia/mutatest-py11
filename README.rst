:code:`mutatest`: Python mutation testing
==========================================

Have a high test coverage number? Try out :code:`mutatest` and see if your tests will detect small
modifications (mutations) in the code. Surviving mutations represent subtle changes that might
slip past your continuous integration checks and are undetectable by your tests.


Features:
    - Pure Python, there are no external dependencies.
    - Simple command line tool.
    - Does not modify your source code, only the :code:`__pycache__`.
    - Flexible enough to run on a whole package or a single file.
